# jsfiddle_external_resource
Little piece of code to see output/result of jsfiddle snippets easier (without HTML code)

###Intructions:
* Just add the raw version of the fiddle-console.js file from this repo to the "External resources pannel" of your jsfiddle.

Note: Since the url's have changed slightly for Github (is not a CDN), we need <https://rawgit.com/> instead (which is powered by MaxCDN): <https://rawgit.com/gugol2/jsfiddle_external_resource/master/fiddle-console.js>

Note2: To be able to see output from console.log() in JSFiddle, go to External Resources on the left-side panel and add the following link for Firebug:
<https://getfirebug.com/firebug-lite-debug.js>
