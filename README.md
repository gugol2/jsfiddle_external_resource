# jsfiddle_external_resource
Little piece of code to see output/result of jsfiddle snippets easier (without HTML code)

###Intructions:
* Just add the raw version of the fiddle-console.js file from this repo to the "External resources pannel" of your jsfiddle.
Note: Since the url's have changed slightly for Github (is not a CDN), we need <https://rawgit.com/> instead (which is powered by MaxCDN): <https://rawgit.com/gugol2/jsfiddle_external_resource/master/fiddle-console.js>
